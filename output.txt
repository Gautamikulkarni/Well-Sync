1.Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults (LADA) 
Definition & Characteristics 
• LADA is a slowly progressing form of autoimmune diabetes that shares features with both 
Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. 
• Often misdiagnosed as Type 2 diabetes due to its late onset in adulthood. 
• Patients initially do not require insulin therapy but eventually develop insulin dependence. 
Prevalence & Epidemiology 
• Accounts for 2% to 12% of all diabetes cases globally. 
• More common in people diagnosed with diabetes between 30-50 years of age. 
• Higher occurrence in individuals with autoimmune disorders like thyroid disease. 
Causes & Risk Factors 
• Autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing β-cells in the pancreas. 
• Presence of autoantibodies (especially GADA – Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase Antibodies). 
• Genetic susceptibility (HLA genes associated with autoimmune diseases). 
• Lifestyle factors like stress, diet, and sedentary habits may accelerate onset. 
Symptoms 
• Similar to Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes but with a gradual progression. 
• Frequent urination, increased thirst, unexplained weight loss, and fatigue. 
• Poor response to oral diabetes medications over time. 
Diagnosis 
• Requires detection of autoantibodies (GADA, IA-2, ZnT8, and ICA). 
• C-peptide levels help differentiate from Type 2 diabetes (lower levels suggest β-cell 
destruction). 
• Misdiagnosis as Type 2 diabetes is common due to mild symptoms at onset. 
Treatment & Management 
• Initially managed with lifestyle changes and oral hypoglycemics. 
• Insulin therapy becomes necessary as β-cell function declines. 
• Regular monitoring of blood glucose and autoantibody levels. 
• Importance of early diagnosis to delay complications and optimize treatment.
